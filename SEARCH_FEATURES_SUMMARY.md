## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Filter Logic
```kotlin
val filteredResults = remember(searchResults, selectedCategory, selectedYear, selectedRating) {
    searchResults.filter { movie ->
        val categoryMatch = selectedCategory == "All" || movie.category == selectedCategory
        val yearMatch = selectedYear == "All" || movie.releaseYear.toString() == selectedYear
        val ratingMatch = when (selectedRating) {
            "All" -> true
            "9+" -> movie.rating >= 9.0
            "8+" -> movie.rating >= 8.0
            "7+" -> movie.rating >= 7.0
            "6+" -> movie.rating >= 6.0
            else -> true
        }
        categoryMatch && yearMatch && ratingMatch
    }
}
```

### State Management

- Automatic recomposition when filters change

### UI Features
