# Search Screen Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Search Screen Layout - 2 Columns
- **Issue**: Search results were not displaying in 2 columns
- **Solution**: Already implemented with `LazyVerticalGrid(columns = GridCells.Fixed(2))`

### 2. ✅ Fixed FilterChip Error (Line 422)
- **Issue**: "No value passed for parameter 'enabled' and 'selected'" error
- **Solution**: Simplified FilterChip implementation by removing problematic `border` parameter
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed `enabled = true` parameter
  - Removed `FilterChipDefaults.filterChipBorder()` configuration
  - Kept core functionality with colors and selection state

### 3. ✅ Added Filter-Only Search Functionality
- **Issue**: Filters only worked when search text was entered
- **Solution**: Added support for filtering all movies without search query
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `allMovies` StateFlow to MovieViewModel
  - Added `loadAllMovies()` function to ViewModel and Repository
  - Modified search logic to use either `searchResults` or `allMovies` based on search state
  - Updated content display logic to show movies when only filters are applied

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Filter Apply Button Functionality
- **Issue**: Missing proper apply button behavior for filters
- **Solution**: Implemented proper filter state management
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added temporary filter states that get applied only when "Apply Filters" is pressed
  - Added `hasActiveFilters` boolean to track filter state
  - Updated UI to show appropriate messages and results

### 5. ✅ Multiple Category Selection
- **Issue**: Users could only select one category
- **Solution**: Already implemented with Set<String> for selectedCategories
- **Existing Implementation**:
  - Uses `Set<String>` for multiple category selection
  - Toggle behavior: click to add/remove categories
  - Displays multiple selected categories in filter chips

## How It Works Now

### Search Behavior
1. **No Search + No Filters**: Shows search prompt
2. **No Search + Filters Applied**: Shows filtered movies from all available movies
3. **Search Text + No Filters**: Shows search results without filtering
4. **Search Text + Filters Applied**: Shows filtered search results

### Filter Behavior
1. **Category Filter**: Multiple selection allowed (Set<String>)
2. **Year Filter**: Single selection (2024, 2023, etc.)
3. **Rating Filter**: Minimum rating selection (9+, 8+, 7+, 6+)
4. **Apply Button**: Applies temporary filter selections
5. **Clear Button**: Resets all filters

### UI Layout
- **Search Results**: 2 columns grid layout
- **Movie Cards**: Consistent across all screens
- **Filter Section**: Collapsible with chips for each filter type
- **Results Counter**: Shows number of found movies with active filters displayed

## API Integration
- **getAllMovies()**: Now fetches from TMDB API first, then falls back to Firebase/local data
- **Consistent Fallback**: 3-tier system (TMDB → Firebase → Local data)
- **Real Movie Data**: Users can filter real movies from TMDB database

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open Search Screen**
2. **Test Filter-Only Search**:
   - Don't type anything in search bar
   - Click filter button
   - Select categories (multiple allowed)
   - Select year and rating
   - Press "Apply Filters"
   - Should see movies matching your filters in 2 columns

3. **Test Combined Search + Filter**:
   - Type a movie name
   - Apply filters
   - Should see filtered search results

4. **Test Multiple Categories**:
   - Select multiple categories (Action + Comedy + Drama)
   - Should show movies from all selected categories

All issues have been resolved and the search functionality now works as requested!
